# glacial-lake-outburst-detection
An AI-powered Early Warning System for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) using sensors, drones, data fusion, digital twin simulation, and failure-first risk modeling.
## 📌 Overview
Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are sudden and catastrophic floods caused by the failure of glacial lakes. This project proposes an **AI-powered Early Warning System** that predicts failures *before* they happen using real-time data, simulations, and intelligent risk analysis.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
GLOFs have caused massive loss of life, destruction of villages, infrastructure damage, and economic loss.  
Existing systems often:
- Detect floods **after** failure
- Rely on limited sensor data
- Do not simulate future scenarios

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A **Failure-First, Multi-Modal Early Warning System** that:
- Predicts GLOF risk before rupture
- Simulates flood behavior using a Digital Twin
- Sends targeted alerts only to affected zones

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### Step 1 — Data Collection at Glacier Lake
Sensors continuously collect:
- Water level
- Water pressure
- Temperature
- Rainfall
- Ground vibrations
- Glacier movement  

Additional sources:
- Drones capture cracks and erosion
- Cameras monitor lake conditions  

📡 Result: Live field data

### Step 2 — Data Transmission
All collected data is transmitted via:
- IoT networks
- Satellite communication  

To:
- Cloud server / Central control system  

⏱ Real-time data flow

### Step 3 — Multi-Modal Data Fusion
The system combines:
- Sensor data
- Drone imagery
- Weather forecasts
- Satellite data
- Historical flood records  

🧠 AI analyzes all data together.

### Step 4 — Living Digital Twin Simulation
A virtual replica of the glacial lake:
- Updates in real time
- Simulates future conditions
- Tests possible lake burst scenarios  

🔮 Predicts outcomes before real failure

### Step 5 — Failure-First Modeling
Instead of waiting for disaster, the system asks:
- Where will failure start?
- How fast will flood water travel?
- Which villages will be affected?
- How much evacuation time is available?

### Step 6 — Risk Prediction Output
The system generates:
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Time before possible breach
- Flood path
- Affected zones

### Step 7 — Targeted Alerts
Alerts are sent **only to danger zones** via:
- SMS alerts
- Authority dashboards
- Emergency notifications

### Step 8 — Intervention Recommendation
The system suggests actions like:
- Controlled water release
- Temporary evacuation
- Dam reinforcement
- Emergency preparedness

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits
- Saves lives
- Reduces economic losses
- Improves disaster preparedness
- Enables early evacuation
- Supports climate resilience

## 🚀 Future Scope
- AI model enhancement
- Integration with government disaster systems
- Mobile app for alerts
- Automated response systems
- Global glacier monitoring
